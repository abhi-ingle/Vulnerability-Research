# Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal in Markdown to PDF VS Code Extension

## Description

The yzane Markdown PDF VS Code extension version 1.5.0 contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability due to improper handling of file paths, allowing path traversal. This vulnerability enables an attacker to read sensitive files on the system where the extension is installed, leading to potential information disclosure.

## Impact

**High** - Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the victim's system, potentially exposing sensitive information.

## Exploitability

**Medium** - Any local user with access to VS Code can exploit the vulnerability. The exploit is simple to produce by crafting a malicious Markdown file.

## Common Weakness Enumeration

**CWE-22**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

**Base Score**: 7.0 - Vector: `CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`

## Technical Details

During the processing of user-provided Markdown files, the extension fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths included in the content. This flaw allows **unauthorized access to sensitive files** on the system, which can then be rendered into the PDF format.
