# SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)

## Technical Details
The Relaxedjs tool does not properly sanitize user-supplied template inputs, which allows for arbitrary code execution via Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious template code that is executed and is visible in the rendered pdf.

## Impact
Many tools and web applications use Relaxedjs for PDF creation. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could affect many applications which run RelaxedJS
